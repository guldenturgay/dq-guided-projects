f you'd like more practice, you can look at the schema and come up with some more business questions, and then write queries to answer them. Here are a few to get you started:

How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?
Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity?
Do protected vs non-protected media types have an effect on popularity?
