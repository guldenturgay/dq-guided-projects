Here are some potential next steps:

Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores
Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools
If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.
Assigning scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.
