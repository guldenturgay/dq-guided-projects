We encourage you to keep exploring these other visualizations on your own. Here are some ideas:

Use a grouped bar plot to compare the number of men with the number of women in each category of majors.
Use a box plot to explore the distributions of median salaries and unemployment rate.
Use a hexagonal bin plot to visualize the columns that had dense scatter plots from earlier in the project.
