We recommend that you continue with the following steps:

Decide how to handle the rest of the missing values. Then, aggregate the data according to the service_cat column again. How many people in each career stage resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
Clean the age column. How many people in each age group resgined due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
Instead of analyzing the survey results together, analyze each survey separately. Did more employees in the DETE survey or TAFE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?
