To extend this project, you might like to consider one or more of the following:

Transform the the dates into a SQLite compatible format.
Extract the line scores into innings level data in a new table.
Create views to make querying stats easier, eg:
Season level stats.
All time records.
Supplement the database using new data, for instance:
Add data from retrosheet game logs for years after 2016.
Source and add missing pitcher information.
Add player level per-game stats.
Source and include base coach data.
